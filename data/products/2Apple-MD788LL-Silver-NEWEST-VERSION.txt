        "property1": "I wish I could say I love my iPad Air because my kids bought it for me for Christmas. Within a month, there was a crack across the screen. I did NOT drop it. It's in a ZaggFolio case with a keypad and it's a great case. When I called Apple, they accused me of dropping it. I can have the screen replaced for $300. Hello? Within the next couple of months, the web was full of people who had bought this Air and their screens were broken. They get them replaced and they break again. I am not able to post the link on here, but you can check out the Apple site for just a sampling of complaints and questions that you will note has not been addressed at all by Apple.There is a clearly a problem with the screen. If you don't mind fractures across your iPad, this might be the one for you. We are an Apple family. Spent thousands on phones and computers for years. So disappointed in this model.",

          "text": "Design:This new iPad is so thin and light it’s amazing. It comes in weighing a little over 1lb.I upgraded from the iPad 3 and you can defiantly feel the difference. When reading with the iPad 3, after a few minutes my arms would be tired of holding the iPad up. With the new iPad Air, that is not the case anymore. I can read for much longer now and my arms don't feel tired. The unit is also easier to hold (much thinner than previous versions of the iPad)It’s built of high quality aluminum just like every other iPad is and constructed to last.PerformanceThe new iPad air is fast! It has an A7 processor in it which is defiantly an upgrade from the previous iPads. The Wi-Fi is even quicker to connect and I notice I can achieve more of my potential in bandwidth speed using this iPad. The new front facing camera makes video chatting much better and the M7 chip makes editing and slow motion shooting fun and a breeze.StorageI upgraded from a 16 GB iPad 3 to a 128 GB iPad Air. Why you ask? Well because I do a lot of traveling for work and Apple is notorious for sneaking in extra stuff on your hard drive that takes up space. My iPad 3 came with only 13.8 GB useable space and after a month I had 3 or 4 GB of “other” storage that no one could figure out how to remove or clear.I mentioned earlier I travel a lot for work so I enjoy watching movies on the plane rides. With my old iPad I never had room for all my movies I had to use a wireless hard drive (Seagate Wireless Built In Streaming STCK1000100Just to watch my movies. Now with this new 128 GB hard drive I can fit tons of movies on it and I no longer need the old wireless hard drive. (One less thing to lose on travel)Final thought:For people who have an older iPad (like I did) then this is a no brainer buy this new iPad you won’t be disappointed! It is much lighter than previous versions. Wayyy faster! And still sleek and built to last as every other iPad is. The new storage options give you the ability to carry more pictures, movies, books , games with you and the battery life is superb coming in at 10+hours. Overall I am happy with my purchase. It might be a little expensive, but if you buy smart you'll have this tablet for a long time with no problems.",

        "property1": "This is my 3rd iPad. I've had original iPad, iPad 3, and now the Air. Many people may say iPad is not worth the price for what it does, but in my case, it was worth every penny. I used iPad 3 and now the Air mostly for browsing the web, reading textbooks, and occasional gaming, and for these tasks iPad Air is perfect; not to mention, I've saved a couple of hundreds on textbooks already. Air is much lighter and faster than the other iPads I've had so far. Now, I can easily hold it longer while reading longer texts, and I can see the performance increase in web browsing and games.Mini vs. Air DilemmaI first got the new iPad Mini with Retina display, because the Apple sales person said it is identical to iPad Air in every aspect other than screen size. Of course it turned out to be wrong, since mini is a bit slower and has the display color accuracy issue. After a week, I went back and exchanged the mini for iPad Air. While mini is a wonderful tablet, I was keeping it much closer to my eyes that I liked to. Web browsing also suffered a lot on a smaller screen of the mini even with Retina. With iPad Air, everything is back to normal again, and I can browse the web more easily now.Wi-Fi vs. 4G CellularI have had the cellular version of iPad 3 and the original iPad. To be honest, I only enabled the service for a few months and disabled it afterwards. I find myself to be always near Wi-Fi networks, either at school or work, so I decided to get the Wi-Fi version this time. Another reason was that I can always turn on the Hot-Spot feature on my phone, and share the internet with iPad Air. Because of these points, it didn't make any sense to pay $130 more for the cellular version.Games and PerformanceI've tried a few games, including Dead Trigger 2, and the 3D performance is very good. The new A7 processor really shines here. I am sure new wave of 3D and 64-bits games will come to iPad pretty soon, and if you are into gaming, definitely go with larger than 16GB models. The web browsing performance has been increased as well, so you can browse the web more fluidly.ConclusionI am pretty happy with my purchase. The free iLife and iWork packages with the purchase of new iPad from Apple sealed the deal for me. It is much better than my previous iPad 3, and I definitely love the new reduced weight. The performance increase is also noticeable both in games and web browsing. If you are coming from older iPads, you will probably appreciate the new design and performance as well.",

        "property1": "When the first iPad was released in the spring of 2010, it was accompanied by a cacophony of jokes about its name and its size. Three and a half years later, the release of the iPad Air, the fifth full-size tablet Apple has offer, has been much calmer. This is the fourth full-size iPad I have owned, beginning with the AT&T 3G model which was released in May, 2010, about a month after the first WiFi only iPads arrived. Every one of my iPads has had an AT&T cellular data.Until this model I have purchased the largest capacity solid state drive Apple has offered. This year there is a 128GB iPad, which costs about $100 more than my 64GB model. Here is the reason I did not select the higher capacity-iCloud. Data stored on iCloud is instantly available across multiple IOS and OSX devices. With all that storage (I buy 50GBs annually) why duplicate it on a hard disk?The iPad Air is incredibly light(about a pound) and has a slightly smaller external footprint than previous models. The retina display actually seems sharper, if such a thing is possible. It also holds a charge for even longer than before.Beyond the physical beauty of the iPad Air is its amazing utility. As a trial lawyer I can easily access the firm's network. This means that every file and every document is instantly at my command. In just a few years time I have learned that I no longer need to drag loads of paper files and depositions with me to court.Over 400,000 apps are built exclusively for iPad, and well over a million iPhone apps run on my device as well. It is an incredibly powerful platform, well on its way to replacing laptops for all but the most labor intensive tasks. When I travel, I typically bring only my iPad-no laptop, no hard copy of a file. I didn't really appreciate just how dependent I had become on the iPad until this June when a federal judge held that I could bring either a laptop or a tablet into the courthouse. I chose the iPad.My weapon of choice-the iPad. This is the one tablet to buy if you are serious about using a tablet. It's pricy, but it may well be, the perfect tablet.",

        "property1": "I almost bought a smaller screen tablet, but when I held the iPad Air, I couldn't believe how impossibly thin and light it feels. Plus, the rounded edges on the back make this really comfortable to hold for long periods.I'm glad I went with Apple, because the quality is unbeatable. For something I use everyday, like a tablet, it really is worth the investment. As powerful as a computer, but an absolute dream to use. The iPad Air now comes with the feature-rich word processor and spreadsheets apps, called Pages and Numbers. With included cloud-based collaborative features that can even be accessed from a PC.While there may be cheaper tablets on the market, you certainly get what you pay for. For something that you'll use everyday, from the sofa to the bed, to the coffee shop and your next flight, I would choose a quality companion. You can't do any better than this.",

        "property1": "I had first purchased the iPad when it first came out, wasn't impressed and returned it. Bought the 2nd version, loved it and have had it ever since. When they came out with the 3rd version I wasn't impressed with the changes so I kept my iPad 2. Ditto when they came out with the next version. But I saw the iPad Air in person and had a chance to try it for myself. I loved the new camera (much more defined pictures) and the screen definition (it's now hi-def). Beautiful sharp, clear colors. So I upgraded and bought it (I bought the white one though.) I was fortunate that the place I bought the iPad Air from accepted my iPad 2 as a trade in so I got it for approximately $200 less (my iPad was in immaculate condition and I still had the box, paperwork and the accessories.) I do love this iPad. It's fast, fast, fast and my games are beautiful. I have both Microsoft and Apple products (although no Apple computers, they're too expensive.) Both have their merits, but I have to say one thing for the Apple products, upgrading to new devices and transferring all your programs, particularly games, is so much easier. On Microsoft products, with Windows, you have to reinstall all of your games and programs, and with the games pray that the new operating system will let you play your old games. In most cases it won't and you have to go through a bunch of iterations to play them (and I say this while typing on an HP Laptop which I use daily and would rather DIE than go without it!) I don't know why Microsoft, (maybe it's the game developers) won't let you back up your games or the programs like Excel, Word, etc (even though you've already paid for them.) But with Apple you just attach it to your computer and sync it (hopefully you backed up your iPad, or whatever, to it) and voila, all your previous games, music, programs are on the Apple product ready to use just where you left off (most of the time anyway. On a few of the games I had to start from the beginning, but I think that's because of the developer, not the iPad because some of them I did start where I left off.) Also, set up for programs such as mail is minimal (just put in your user name and password and you're ready to go.) I wish Microsoft would come out with something like that so I could purchase a new computer without the fear of not being able to play my favorite games. Anyway, bottom line I LOVE my new iPad Air. I even found a case that allows me to swivel the stand to either landscape or portrait positions so that I can read the newspaper or books on it and eat at the same time without having to try and prop it up on something (bought the case on Amazon.com, it's a Targus Versavu).",

        "property1": "First of all, I have never owned an ipad before but I have used other's ipads and was impressed with them. I also have a motorola xoom and it doesn't even come close to the ease of use and just generally aesthetics of this ipad. Its probably best that I break it down into pros and cons to give the most accurate picture I can of what I have found since I bought myself, my wife and my son all the new ipad Airs.--The Good--The business apps I use are all exactly what I hoped for. I use Chrome for browser and it looks incredible. When tablets came out, this is what I imagined browsing the internet should look like on a tablet. The form factor is great, and the Air is as light as advertised. Despite other's claims of durability issues, I have found it to be quite durable even with my minimal case. Movies in correct format play flawlessy and my music sounds great. Paired with some good headphones, long plane trips become tolerable in the worst of seats. Facetiming with family is a breeze and the 'cool' factor is definitely still present.--The Bad--There are also some cons which I think takes the Air down a half star to a star. First off the 16GB model which I purchased for my wife from a big box store after I purchased my 64GB from Amazon is simply not enough memory. I know thats a choice etc but for those that are purchasing for the first time, do NOT buy the 16 GB model unless you plan on mostly using for browsing the internet. Apps + music + movies will fill up your 16 (actually less after what IOS takes up) gigs very quickly.Second, they should have put a little more RAM in. The browser occaisonally crashes and there is definitely some latency on scrolling for more content intensive pages.Lastly a few random complaints; the screen also seems dimmer than the ipad with retina (last generation), there is no additional storage, and there seems to be a growing number of junk apps/games.--The Ugly--I will preface this with this: only power users are likely to encounter the ugly.Synching with Apple TV is not as easy as advertised. Sometimes the air icon shows up, sometimes it doesn't.You can play MKV files but it is painful. You need a third party player, then you have to transfer movies via http (drag and drop doesn't work), and you will not see where that space went, should you forget about things you've transferred via that method.If you have a home media server and use a PC, itunes + network drives + adding files to the ipad reminds me of the days of the 2400 baud modem. You wait, and you wait, and you wait. Anything you really want to transfer, transfer it from your network drive to your pc, then add to library, then transfer to ipad.--Overall--I still prefer this to my android pad or any other tablets I have encountered. The pros outweigh the cons if you have the money to spend considering how much more these are than comperable android tablets.",
