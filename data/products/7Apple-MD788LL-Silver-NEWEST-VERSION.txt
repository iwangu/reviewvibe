Remember what your mom and dad explained to you was the reason for that public humiliation? Because they liked you too! The same principle applies to all the competitors that say bad things about the iPad. It's because secretly, they want to BE the iiPad.You can buy a competitor's product, but any way you slice it, it won't even begin to measure up. Just remember, every time they say something negative, they are really saying how much they love the iPad. Nothing else compares to the bright screen on the iPad Air, or the way that it feel resting ever so lightly in your hands. It just feels right.And that is what Apple has done so right. It never wavered or varied based on the negative opinions of other companies. It never even responded to them. On the playground Apple walks away without a scratch, without trying, and without lifting a finger to respond to any other tablet's challenge. It doesn't have to. And everybody loves it. See, mom really does know best.",
