        "property1": "I bought my Nexus 10 after my mother stole my Nexus 7 from me and I'm sure glad she did. My girlfriend had just gotten an iPad 4 for Nursing School so I had something to compare it with.Let me say the screen is the pinnacle for tablets by far, just watch the planet earth HD episode that comes with. The pixel density is much better than the iPad but not as saturated, which is fine with me because it looks fake. The speakers set it apart from any tablet in terms of loudness and the fact they are front facing so you don't have to look like an idiot cupping the back of your tablet for people to hear. The camera is surprisingly good; auto focuses and takes photos very fast. Skype looks better on here than my laptop, not to mention its nice to use the back camera for a video tour, concert, etc. Its extremely fast with no hiccups that I've noticed (in 3 months). Frequent updates which is rare for a Android device. Coming from the Tegra 3 quad core processor on the Nexus 7, the dual core A15 1.9Ghz and Mali GPU on the 10 plays games just as well which is impressive for the best screen in tablets. Movies don't get any better. The absolute best video experience in tablets, I guarantee. As an engineering student, this device has been more than capable and helped me be organized and prepared for classes.Reasons why I like my Nexus 10 over my girlfriend's iPad 4:-better screen-front facing speakers-better multi-tasking-more customization-can open zips-can download attachments from sites that the iPad can-can use flash-can plug in any USB accessories with OTG cable (flash drive, mouse, keyboard, xbox controller) without installing anything or paying for over priced device specific accessories*iOS does have more tablet optimized apps but that's the OS and not the device itself. This tablet is hardware superior in every way and the OS is much more capable.",

        "property1": "I thought comparing both units and the Nexus 10 on its own would be a good idea, since many people ask themselves which to buy. Ill rate each area on a 0-5 scale, 5 being the best.Sound:Note 10.1 - 4.5Nexus 10 - 4.8Both units have great front facing speaking. They do both however lack good low-end. The Nexus edges ahead for being the louder of the 2, and having a clearer upper frequency range.Screen:Note 10.1 - 4.6Nexus 10 - 4.6They tie. I know that may seem weird, seeing as the Nexus has that great resolution and DPI, but read on. The resolution of the Nexus is GREAT. I used a few HD Space live wallpaper to compare, and WOW, they look great on the Nexus. My problem with the Nexus is colors are very washed out, on the Note 10.1 colors are very vibrant with deep saturation. When it comes to reading PDFs, Word, and internet browsing, both screens to about the same. Most websites are scaled for average, not high, resolutions. PDF/Docs are both very readable. There is a slight sharpness increase from the Nexus, but you have to really zoom in to see it. Games on both units perform well, but each has its ups and downs. The HD screen provides detail, but the washed our colors really show in HD games and the Note looks better in that regard. Unless youre truly using 1080p+ content, you wont really notice much difference. THe Nexus also has a bit of light bleed, while the Note doesnt.Construction:Note 10.1 - 4.2Nexus 10 - 4.8I should preface by saying, I have NO problem with plastic bodies. My problem with the Note is that the plastic feels very thin, and has a LOT of give, and can even \"crink\" when flexing. The Nexus 10 feels VERY solid, and the grippy texture on the back is great. If it wasnt for my Note being in a case, Id worry about it alot, the Nexus, less so. The buttons on the Nexus also seem better build, the are firm and have a good \"click\" when used.Performance (real world):Note 10.1 - 4.4Nexus 10 - 4.6The Nexus edges out ahead just a bit. The UI and app performance is consistently better. Its hard to say if thats because of the hardware or slight better hardware. The only area the Nexus struggled with was using ezPDF. For some reason turning pages made the Nexus skip frame rates, I'm would guess that the app more than the tablet. Games and Apps run great in both, but the Note SOMETIMES hiccups a bit, the Nexus has yet to.Battery Life:Note 10.1 - 4.8Nexus 10 - 4.6Both Units have great battery life when it comes to \"real world\" use. My Note lasts my 5ish days, while the Nexus last 3ish. Given the increased screen resolution being rendered and the higher clocked hardware, this is a reasonable tradeoff. Keep in mind these times were achieved with a tuned OS. Rooted with all unneeded services/programs disabled, and I run DS Battery saver on its most aggressive preset.Productivity:Note 10.1 - 4.9Nexus 10 - 4.3Its REALLY hard to beat the Note in productivity. Multi-window is great, S-pen for handwriting notes and drawing is unmatched.Misc:Note 10.1 - 4.4Nexus 10 - 4.6This is mostly how much work it takes to fully setup tablet as a power-user. Both devices root easily. The Note has MANY more services and bloatware to be tuned to really max out the performance of the OS. The Nexus, well thats pretty stock, so only a bit of trimming is required.Stability:Note 10.1 - 4.8Nexus 10 -4.8Updated to the latest OS on both, they both run great. Ive yet to have an OS lock, random reset, or had to hard reset on either. Both have gotten the occasional random app freeze, but its occasional and most likely the app, not the OS. Its worth noting both tablet to well at recovering from app freezes when they do happen, the OS never needs a hard reset.Storage:Note 10.1 - 4.9Nexus 10 - 4.8The Note wins out of box because it got a built in memory card slot. You can root the Nexus and buy an OTG cable and a USB card reader and get the same function. Its just one more step, and added cost though.So how do you choose between the 2?The Note right now is all about productivity. If youre a student looking to take digital notes, or looking for general productivity the Note wins hands down. I cant tell you the amount of times Ive pulled up a PDF, Word/Powerpoint doc side by side with Papyrus (my preferred note taking app). As a media device the Nexus is better. Music is louder and clearer, and movies in HD look great.If anyone would like anything else comparing side-by-side just ask, Id be happy to add it.",

        "property1": "Over a period of several weeks I tried out the following. (I will post this same review in Amazon under each device.)1. ASUS Transformer T100 hybrid tablet/notebook \u20282. Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 Tablet\u20283. Google Nexus 10 tabletI also looked at an iPad Air. They are way overpriced. And I still have a grudge against Apple for the 2012 hard drive recall they had on our 27\" iMac. It was a total disaster. We didn't lose any data but it took weeks and endless phone calls to get it running right again.After spending a day getting used to Windows 8, I thought the ASUS might be the one I was going to keep. I actually only tried it for two days. Early on day three I shut it down only to have it remain on the \"Shutting Down\" screen for an extended time period. So I powered it off. Apparently, my bad. Subsequently it would not reboot into Windows, reset or repair even after talking with ASUS Tech Support. They asked me to return it to them for repair. I declined and returned it to WallyWorld.I liked the ASUS. It was attractive but a fingerprint magnet both front and back. And it was more difficult to use than Android. The two issues that bothered me most were the lack of a Swype app and the complications of dictation. The best Swype-type app in the Windows Store is TouchPal. It ain't that good. First of all the virtual keyboard is large. Your finger has to cover a lot of real estate to enter characters. Also, the word prediction accuracy sucks. Windows-supported dictation was not that accurate, so I had to go into Google to dictate. This was not nearly as handy as being in a Google operating system to begin with. I use Swype and dictation a lot.The mentioned issues relate to Windows 8 not the physical unit. I liked the ASUS unit enough that I discovered they make several similar models running Android. After checking these out I found they were either running old versions of Android or cost a couple of hundred dollars more than the two Samsung models mentioned here. So, that ended that.It was hard to choose between the Nexus and the Galaxy, Both are made by Samsung. I waited several weeks to see if a new Nexus 10 was coming out but to no avail.As far as looks go, the Galaxy is very thin and attractive. In my opinion it is as nice looking as an iPad even though it has more plastic. I had the white one so fingerprints were not that visible. The Galaxy gets compliments for its narrow bezels. However these are really a functional negative. They cause you to touch and activate stuff on the screen accidentally quite often. Makes me suspect the iPad has the same problem. There are a lot of complaints about the large area of sensitivity for the three built-in keys at the bottom of the Galaxy. However I thought this was minor compared to the narrow side bezels. (You can probably negate the side bezel problem by putting the unit in a folio case. It could give you more to hang onto.) The speakers are on the top of the sides and are easy to cover up when holding the unit.Though made by Samsung, because Google's name is on it the Nexus is first in line for Android updates. It has already downloaded the latest Android version, KitKat. It will also be the first to get future updates since there is no manufacturer software OS overlay to wait for. It is pure Android--no bloatware. In terms of specs, the Nexus blows the other two units away. The broad bezels may not be as attractive but they give you something to hang onto without accidental screen touches. The Nexus' rubber-like coating on the back is better for grip and not a fingerprint magnet. Less bling but more practical. The Nexus' speakers are on the on the front, the best place.Even though I did not keep the Galaxy and its specs are much less impressive than the Nexus, I found it perfectly satisfactory for my needs. I do mainly Web browsing, Email, some text and spreadsheet documents and a few non-graphic intensive games. I bought all of these units from local big box stores. The Nexus 10 was $400 and the two Samsung units were only about $30 less.After considerable researching of portable Bluetooth keyboards, I ordered and just received a Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 Universal Case and Keyboard. I bought this from Amazon and will review it when I have had it for awhile. So far this looks like a terrific and attractive accessory I will probably keep the Nexus in the protective case without the keyboard most of the time. I will use the keyboard when I do a lot of data entry.",

        "property1": "I bought the Nexus 7 for travel and liked it so much that I decided to buy the Nexus 10 to use at home. The Nexus 10 screen was gorgeous, Jelly Bean 4.2 had lots of neat features and the build quality was excellent so I quickly learned to love my new tablet. That is until it started misbehaving. It began with Chrome becoming unresponsive to touch inputs followed by a spontaneous complete shutdown and eventually a reboot. Once it had rebooted, I continued to use it but Chrome kept on freezing up to the point of being unusable. I did some research on the web and discovered that these behaviors were common with the Nexus 10 and the latest version of Jelly Bean. So I reset the device to factory defaults in preparation for a return. However, the next morning I hated the thought of returning the tablet because it was so nice minus the software/hardware hiccups so I reinstalled all my apps and updated them all in the hope that maybe the bad behavior was a fluke. Not so. Chrome began locking up again so I reluctantly returned the Nexus 10. I am disappointed but I am willing to give the next Nexus 10 a chance, hopefully with less buggy software because the rest of the experience was very positive.",

        "property1": "Originally I posted a long history of the Nexus 10 and updated it once. Now that I have used it for a while I will condense it into something easier by eliminating everything I said before and just getting to it:1. A tablet will NOT replace a laptop for web surfing. The Nexus 10 does a darn good job of being a backup internet source but for having to type in web pages, etc, its not that user friendly so you will really need a laptop for home use and this for travel or other.2. Google Play, the online store equivalent of Amazon, is worlds ahead of Amazon is usefulness and ease of use. Searching for books, music, movies is a snap. Everything is loaded into their cloud but you can PIN things to be actually downloaded to your Nexus for like using on a plane withoug Wifi availability.3. I already know that this is going to be great to travel with versus lugging a laptop around. I'm taking books, movies, all my music in one small package. You can also use if for e-ticketing, to travel with an electronic boarding pass.4. Uploading your own music is a piece of cake. Picture is bright and clear. Reading is effortless, and the sound of the music player is impressive. You can easily hear the speakers from 25 feet away so its not toy but its not your surround system either!Last, knowing what I know now, I wish I would have bought the Nexus 7 and 10 instead of the 10 and the Kindle Paperwhite. Again, searching for books in Amazon is like having teeth pulled. I wanted to have both to avail two book stores and two buying options.",

Yes, it is a little slow in charging but nothing I can't live with. I'm sure they will tweak it. Screen is beautiful & browsing is first rate. Highly recommended!",

        "property1": "This tablet replaces a cheap 10\" Android tablet that I bought last year. This 10\" tablet from Google is fantastic! Compared with my other one, Nexus is fast, the new Jelly Bean o/s is simple, intuitive, and fast. Somehow the Internet speed is truly faster than other new tablets including several Asus, Samsung, and iPad models that some of my friends have. The screen is absolutely incredible: video comes in crystal clear and smooth; there is no lag. Stunning!With all the praise, there are always areas of improvement and truthfully I wish I could give it 4-1/2 stars: 1. navigation bar takes real estate: while the new o/s is smooth, the navigation is now always on the screen, 2. the tablet is a bit heavy: you really have to squeeze it tight to hold it along the side with one hand (as I am often trying to do), 3. volume rocker is backwards: I am usually holding the tablet in portrait orientation with the power and volume toward the top, but then you have to hit the rocker up to turn the volume down, perhaps it was designed by a lefty, 4. lack of expansion: I know Google's whole mission is your life on the web, but occasionally, I need to transfer data and don't have an internet connection, I would really love a microSD port (also I could buy a 16GB card less than the $100 premium I paid for the 32GB version of this tablet).Overall, I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a good solid tablet with a superior display.",

The service I had from Google was outstanding, the after sales.....having a Free Phone Number to help me setting everything up and they talked very clear which I was really pleased about.I was extremely pleased how Google had set the tablet up to be so clear, it's really user friendly.The Nexus is such a beautiful device, so smart and the touch screen is so responsive.Because I got it direct from Google themselves I managed to get the 32GB, but it's a shame that you cannot add a Memory card into the device.The speakers are a tiny bit quiet for my liking, but you can actually get an app from Amazon Speaker Boost so you can play your music just like its got surround sound. But if you would rather listen with the head phones, another app in Amazon from the same developer EarpieceThe only trouble was getting my Nexus directly from Google ....the charger started messing up so I had to find another one instead because I knew the device itself was ok. A lovely reviewer found the very Charger that I needed as the Nexus is a 2amp device.You really do have the best of both worlds...Amazon App Store and Google PlayStore.Playing music, games, reading and watching films on this Nexus is terrific. I still use my iPad, but I'm so overwhelmed with this device....you can't buy any better in my opinion and its so comfortable holding it in your hand to play games or reading. I could actually keep praising the Nexus because I love it so much and the fact that you can store all your music, books and games in the cloud from Amazon and Google I am using the Nexus all of the time, maybe a tiny bit more than the iPads.If someone told me about a year ago how much I would be using an Android device today I would never of believed them because back then I was never comfortable with Android, but they have come on Massively over the past year.I did originally buy a case for the Nexus, but I found it to be too heavy so I have removed it out of the case and now I am hoping that I can get an sleeve to protect it when I carry the Nexus in my bag.Because the Nexus 10 is so slim, I have got it in my dressing gown pocket so I can listen to my music whilst I'm walking around the house doing other things at the same time....I never thought I would be able to that with such a big device like this, but that's because it's so light and slim like I mentioned.September 19th 2013**************************I have now in my hand, the new Nexus 7 32GB also bought direct from Google Play and within less than 36hrs of me pressing the buy-now button. It's so smart....I'm so pleased with it, slimmer than the previous Nexus 7 so I'm glad I waited.My Nexus 10 is lovely for playing games on, but found it a tad bit big to read my books so that's why I got the smaller Nexus 7 device",

Google has made the right calls in term of aesthetics and industrial design, while Samsung was able to bring the best hardware to the game. The display is beautiful and the system has enough muscles to handle any media you throw at it.The most surprising aspect of the Google Nexus 10 is the price: At $399 (16GB, WiFi), the Google Nexus 10 is significantly cheaper than Apple's iPad 4 which beats it only in polygonal graphics. This is a very aggressive pricing, especially if you think that this powerful tablet costs a mere $70 more than the iPad mini which is far less potent.If you want a tablet for basic things like email, web, gaming and apps, this is the best option for now. It is both cheaper and better than most of the competition. There are a few exceptions: if you want a stylus, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a better alternative, and if you need Microsoft Office compatibility, the Microsoft Surface RT would be better. Unless you absolutely want iOS, there is simply no compelling reason to pay $100 more for an iPad. If you do, well... it's settled.",
