        "property1": "Roku 3 enhanced my viewing experience, and it instantly solved a long-standing problem. Let me explain.My internet cable provider's download speed is sometimes slow. This caused my TV'S (55\" Vizio) built-in Amazon Video app to pause during viewing while the next video buffer is being delivered. Same thing would happen watching Netflix. When I used my older Roku XD, the same thing would happen, except the Roku would reduce the quality until there was a continuous video stream.As soon as I learned the new Roku 3 had a dual core processor, I reasoned that it might be able to render video at the same time it was fetching the next video buffer thus providing a continuous HD viewing experience. Well, after going through the very easy installation process, the Roku 3 allowed me to watch - for the first time - Downton Abbey in continuous HD! As a reality check, I switched back to the Vizio TV's app and the Roku XD and got the same old degraded viewing experience.The Roku 3's remote uses Bluetooth, which means you don't have to aim it at the box; just leave it where it is and it works great. The headphone jack is a nice added touch to the remote which makes me want a second Roku 3 for late night viewing in the bedroom.",

        "property1": "So recently my (cable) internet provider changed their system so that you need a converter box to receive even the most basic local channels on any TV including current HDTVs. A lot of cable providers are currently doing this. Call me cheap ;) or call it a matter of principal but I refuse to pay upwards of $50 - $150 per month for cable or satellite programming since I had been living just fine on a steady diet of local channels and internet (standard HULU, Netflix, MTV, VH1, etc...) already. Now, I do need an internet connection for work so that part is a given for me.That being said, I was looking for a device to help me further CUT THE CORD like many of you or perhaps a better way to describe what I am after... utilize my internet connection in a way that wouldn't create more monthly costs but give me access to cable or satellite *LIKE* programming. I might add that I live in a rather challenging situation for on air antennas... the second floor of a three story condo building with my only outside walls facing the opposite direction of the television towers which are about 30 miles away.After some challenges trying to find an on air antenna to actually pull in a few local stations AND adding this Roku 3... I can honestly say that I have finally found a solution that I am happy with that definitely gives me WAY more channels than I had at no additional monthly costs (beyond a few purchases). The Roku 3 is a very nice device (and worth the price IMHO) but to say that it is a direct replacement for cable or satellite TV would be misleading. It is a different animal, behaves very differently, and has different requirements than your TV or SET TOP CONVERTER BOX. You really just can't start flipping through channels haphazardly and expect some instant gratification. It doesn't work that way (or doesn't yet). If you already subscribe to Netflix over the internet, think of THAT user interface and experience as that will give you an idea. You should expect buffering times (time it takes the video to load or clear up) at the very least. Depending on the content you are accessing and/or how you are accessing it, these buffering times could vary from 2 to 60+ seconds after clicking through the prompts and making your channel selection. It is more like...search, select, click, and then wait/buffer. This takes some getting used to and is a departure from typical channel surfing or simply selecting a favorite station with one touch on a TV or box remote. There is no real schedule (any kind of TV Guide) or even a road map for the thousands of channels that you have access to... in part because these channels are mainly pre-recorded feeds or links to online content... so that's a challenge too.This brings me to the A-NUMBER-ONE, B-NUMBER-TWO, and C-NUMBER-THREE questions that kept racing through my mind when trying to make this Roku 3 work for me... \"WHERE IS ALL THE \"LIVE\" CONTENT?\", \"DOES A ROKU CHANNEL EXIST THAT GIVES ME \"LIVE\" ACCESS TO NETWORK FEEDS like ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, etc...?\" and \"ARE THERE ANY ROKU CHANNELS THAT GIVE SOME LOCAL PRESENCE (local to the Northern California TV market)?\" NATIVELY, the ROKU 3 will only give you access to VERY LIMITED live programming (if you don't count the live 24/7 Chicken Coupe, Baby Goat, or Puppy cam feeds... YES, THOSE are out there) ;) and will very likely NOT have access to any of your live local channels for news, programming, or otherwise (or it did not for me in this area, your area could vary but still very little as a whole). Now, I say NATIVELY because I had to really go searching for add-on services and ROKU private channels before I found the right combination of local presence (or at least this region), live programming, and that cable or satellite *like* experience that I was hoping for.I was able to do this by adding the PlayOn service (for a one time fee of $40, when you register your Roku on their site). Now, PlayOn has its own set of requirements so be sure to educate yourself on that if you go this route. PlayOn can then be added as a private Roku channel and it helps group the pre-recorded online Internet content (makes standard/free HULU and YouTube available through Roku) AND also extends the live content capability of your Roku device. I then added scripts within the PlayOn service (some of the better ones will cost $5 - $10, one time fee). An example of a PlayOn script/channel that I frequently watch (through my Roku 3) is called SUPERUSVOXTV. The right PlayOn scripts will give you access to loads of live (as it is broadcasted) mainstream content, movie streams, and sports in pseudo real time (minus the buffering that needs to take place, which is usually several seconds behind on air broadcasts). I often watch two other Roku channels called USTVNOW (free with sign up that gives you 7 \"live\" main network channels, upgrade to more channels for a cost) and LIVESTREAM for some regional news (which is free). There are other choice Roku based channels and PlayOn scripts (channels) that I have added but the ones mentioned above are the ones that I frequently use to date. Of course, I use Netflix through the Roku 3 ($7.99/month, which I've had for some time). I also plan to take a good look at the Aereo channel (for a minimal cost) if it should ever come to my area.As for performance, I can also vouch for the speed of this Roku 3 because I also purchased a Roku 2 for the other room. The Roku 3 moves through the built in menus smoother than the other and tends to buffer the picture more quickly (which means the picture clears up faster). Overall, I find that the picture quality to be pretty good on my 1080 and 720 HDTVs, maybe a step below the same on air broadcast showing some slight pixilation WHEN ROKU AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE WORKING AT THEIR BEST. These picture anomalies honestly do not bother me. Please note that there are other requirements for PlayOn and factors native to those scripts that will effect picture quality as well. For me, I find that the quality of the PlayOn feeds can vary wildly (as there are so many factors) but is still very much worth it and a great companion to the Roku. PlayOn programming that I watch is bit unpredictable...something way less than high definition but watchable IHMO. The headphone jack feature on the Roku 3 (not on my Roku 2) is surprisingly useful. The reason I rate this device 4 stars is because frankly today, it may NOT be for everybody... as it still feels a little raw or under developed but with loads of potential when it is fully adopted. The technology is obviously already here to deliver what I am after in a cord cutting solution, but it would be ideal if it required less effort on the end user part. Some of the add on services might lack in the picture quality that you'd expect as I mentioned (which isn't the fault of Roku), and by contrast, a lot of the private and public Roku channels are already in near perfect HD.Those that expect this (imperfections, and that TV over broadband is still being developed) and don't mind digging a bit for the desired content (IMHO, it is likely out there) will be pleasantly surprised. The value in what you have access to (with a some effort) is pretty amazing to me and it won't cost you month in and month out. Those that just want to plug it in and have all the desired content spoon-fed to them, as if it were an old school converter box, will be sorely disappointed or annoyed. I am a huge sports enthusiast. If a sporting event is being televised somewhere, I can usually find it with some effort.I think that when more LIVE NETWORK based content is made (more) readily available, you'll see the Roku seriously competing as the choice HTDV set top companion. I hope my experience and thoughts help you make a good decision. Good Luck! Your experience and mileage may vary...",

        "property1": "Although the number of channels available (over 250) dwarfs what you can get through a streaming Blu-ray player, I encountered several issues with mine and ended up returning it.First, after initial channel selection of the most used channels (Netflix, Amazon, etc.), and setting up the required Roku account, we were unable to add any additional channels to the unit either from the Roku site or via our TV. We noticed that even with the latest firmware downloaded, Netflix videos were not quite as sharp as via a Sony Blu-ray player. We also noticed that the 'multiple user' feature (\"Who's Watching?\") feature of Netflix, which is supported by the Sony player, was not supported by the Roku. Finally, when we, at the instruction of Roku customer service, unplugged and plugged back in the Roku, it got hung up in a boot loop and would never reboot again despite reset. Defective unit? Maybe -- but go to the Roku forum and search for \"won't boot\" -- this appears to be a firmware related problem as well, so my own recommendation is at least make sure you have returns whereever you purchase this. I liked the Roku idea, and would consider trying one again after several more months of firmware upgrades have gone by.",

        "property1": "I was already in the market for a streaming device to connect to my TV when I was introduced to Roku. I was very impressed from the beginning with the fluid menus and extremely easy setup. The device was literally up and running within a couple of minutes. HDMI setup could not be any easier, and the only other cable you need to plug in is the AC Adapter. THAT EASY!Once the setup is complete, you'll have a gazillion audio and video options to choose from. This includes international channels, and even religious content. This was very important for me. No longer do I have to connect my iPad to the TV in order to stream content. The glaring omission that I hope is addressed soon is YouTube thou. I have read of alternate options to connect to it, but it should come standard. Judging by the professionalism and quality of the people behind the device, I'm sure it will happen.Considering everything, I give Roku two thumbs up! I strongly recommend it if you're looking for a competent, reliable, stable and seamless entertainment option. You really can't ask for much more, specially for the price. And if you're still on the fence after reading this and other reviews, I have two words for you: BUY IT! You won't regret it.",

        "property1": "Their customer service is pathetic. My Roku 3 gets too hot and shuts off after couple of hours. Customer service agreed to send a replacement after spending over 30 minutes on the phone, but, only after I send in the defective device. This is the first time I've heard of someone showing distrust in their customers. Not a good business practice in my opinion. They have my credit card on account and I asked them to go ahead and charge if they don't receive the defective unit back within 2 weeks - they did not budge.",

        "property1": "I would like to say this little box is amazing! Super easy to set up. The remote acts like a Wii remote, and also includes a headphone jack. You might be thinking headphone jack...but it's pretty cool once you understand how/why I use it. I am able to listen and stream my music during the day with the tv off and be able to listen to my headphones while surfing the web or walking around my house doing chores. I need to be quite during the day while my night worker hubby sleeps, so this is amazing. I can also switch the input on the tv, so I can still stream and listen to my music while he plays xbox or watches tv. Pretty cool. The Roku also has games to play and the playability is comparable to the Wii remote. Very responsive remote. I like the new Angry Birds Space that came with my box. Also a neat feature is the Roku app that you can download for either Iphone/android. I actually like using my iphone app remote better, since you can connect to your pic's and music. You can show a slideshow of your pic's on the tv, by using the Roku and the app. Pretty slick! I am very impressed. This box streams and responds to your every command without a hitch! We have Xbox 360's, a smart tv and a blu-ray player that we use for streaming things like Netflix, Amazon and Pandora and I will say I love the interface and responsiveness of the Roku much better! Another cool feature that we will be using this summer will be taking the box, remote and an hdmi cord with us. That way we can still stream our tv/movies/music AND be able to keep the kids entertained by playing games!So we will not be spending more $$ on tv/games while in hotels. Also if you have a newer tv in an RV, this could also work assuming you also have internet at wherever you stay! So total win win! I'm glad I was able to experience Roku 3 for myself, or I would have never believed a little black box was so awesome!",
