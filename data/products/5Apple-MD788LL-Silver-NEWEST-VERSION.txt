        "property1": "I managed to avoid 5 generations of ipad purchases (including the 1st generation mini) but this one finally got me. My eye doctor told me if I didn't stop being ridiculous and using my itouch as an ereader (I know, I know but it was so portable!) I could kiss my 20-20 vision goodbye. Basically Apple can thank my optometrist. That being said this thing is gorgeous. It takes beautiful photos and video, the screen is crisp and clear. While I don't run around in public taking photos and video with it I'm happy it has the capability. It's great for watching movies on the go and I've been very happy with the battery life.So why should you buy this one? It's a reasonable size without sacrificing screen size or quality. I think the ipad mini is cute but I have friends who practically have smartphones with a screen that size. It wasn't worth the price for me. We have other ipad products in my family, I've never been motivated enough to go out and buy my own but this one is a good size. It fits in a normal size bag or purse and makes me feel like I'm carrying around a pad of paper rather than a small laptop.I've had several people ask me why I bought a ipad instead of a kindle fire or the like. As I said, we have a lot of iproducts at my house and I'm very happy with itunes. This way I can easily swap movies, tv shows, ebooks, various apps I need on a daily basis around and basically this has turned into a backup laptop for me. The functionality was absolutely worth it to me.I guess if I were to say anything negative it would be 1) I'm never going to live down finally having bought one after saying I wouldn't for so many years and 2) my iphone and itouch now seem incredibly small. I'm hoping the iphone 6 releases soon and has a bigger screen. First world problems to be sure but there you have it.",

        "property1": "I love apple perfect hardware and design. The new iPad air is not a good buy imo. The bezel is too thin thats its so hard to hold without touching the screen and activate random things. Apple didn't upgrade the memory in the iPad Air. It is still 1GB. I don't know why they do this but with only 1GB the iPad won't be good for more than 2 years. Same thing happened to the iPad 1 and iPad 2 because of the limited memory that make everything much slower. I think the 1GB memory is the very bad flaw on the new iPads. Don't support apple because you own their product or you are their fanboy. It is very stupid to do so.Although I love apple's hardware and software, I would not buy another iPad or other apple's products unless I see that they don't hold back on the upgrades.",

        "property1": "I bought the original Apple iPad and have used it regularly since early 2011. A while back my Original iPad no longer qualified for operating system updates due to a slightly smaller memory capacity. It was not easy to get answers from Apple as to why I was unable to get the latest update to load. Over time my original iPad has became less and less useful due to apps not being compatible with the aging operating system and safari going down at in opportune times more and more frequently. So I finally recently purchased the latest iPad Air. It's not that I don't like it, and there are improvements in speed, weight, camera and screen clarity. But to me, it's just not that much better to justify buying a whole new tablet and sending the old one to some recycle center. For my purposes the original one was all I needed and wanted. I would rather be able to keep using my old iPad than have this new one.",

        "property1": "This is my third iPad. I decided on a 32GB because I wanted to load movies on it and a lot of music and not worry about space. I mean when they announce a new version of iOS the last thing I wanted to do was delete something dear to me. I was replacing my iPad 3 16GB with an iPad Air 32GB. There have been many changes. Are these changes enough to warrant the need for an upgrade? I am still not entirely certain but I am more happy than sad about doing that. I haven't been able to sell my iPad 3 but its still looking for a new home. So guys, here is what I like about the iPad Air, what I don't like much and what are some key features or new introductions to this device.The Positives of Upgrading to iPad Air -1) It is lighter, the surface area around the display has been reduced, the design is not revolutionary by any length of a realistic understanding of science but it still has the same battery life. It has lost that annoying 30 pin connector which seems so inconvenient to the new lightning port. I can use this one hand, I can expect the same battery life, the volume button on the iPad 3 seemed less delicate, the iPad Air definitely feels a lot more delicate than the iPad 3 which seems so robust now when I pick it up. But overall I would give them 4 stars for the design changes. I wish it never heated up though but purely from the WEIGHT difference I think its good, the screen for some reason looks better, it must be the upgraded graphic chip.2) The Sound - This is the biggest winner for me. Imagine not having to turn the sound to 100% on your iPad air. It rivals my matchbook air in terms of how loud it is, yes it isn't as loud or roomy or filling but it is more than satisfying. They now have two speakers so its a stereo sound. It is louder than my iPhone 5 and certainly more clear, catchy, bass adoring than I would image from an iPad. This was the surprise winner for me. A bit of a let down in terms of design is that if you're lying and watching a film in portrait mood the speaker sound may be muffled by your stomach/body part in contact with the base of the iPad air. The solution is LANDSCAPE mode. The two speakers are now located on the left and right side of the charging port. No complaints on this. The iPad 3 is maybe 30% as loud as the iPad air.3) Battery Life/Faster Charging Speed - I don't know why but I feel the iPad 3 had a longer battery when it was new. A new apple iPad will last you so long, it will need for you to bore it to death to bring it from 100% to 64%. Yes, this is the case with the new iPad but it isn't as good but overall the fact that charging time seems to have reduced by half is a big big big big winner for me. So overall, no complaints. I don't get 13-14 hours like I used to with my iPad 3. I get 11 hours. Yes, I make the best use of the new sound feature. The fact that it charges faster means I don't need to pull it out before 100% and this is a good thing for the battery. With the iPad 3, I have to wait for it to be 100% charged and it can take unto 8 hours. This has been reduced by almost half and I feel 4-5 hours will give you a 100%.4) Processor - The iOS 7 clearly stalls a bit on the iPad 3. Did I notice this before buying the iPad Air? Yes cause my iPhone 5 was faster than the iPad 3. If you're playing quiz up, everything loads in seconds, if you are browsing, it goes boom boom boom like my macbook air. Well nothing quite compares to browsning on the AIR but this is very good. iPad Air is the best device for youtube because of the loud speaker, I can sit with it for hours and discover various things. The processor seems to heat a lot less. There is never a lag on anything. It doesnt think so much.5) Camera - Camera has improved from the iPad 3. Both the front and the back is more defined. Do I use this? Why wouldn't i?COULD HAVE BEEN BETTERS' WITH THIS IPAD AIR -1) Headphone Jack Placement/Volume Output - This isn't as loud when using with headphones as the iPad 3 used to be. It is a more customised sound. The headphone jack is located at the same place where it used to be but because the surface area is smaller, I have found that when I am lying down and using my iPad AIR, the wires often get a bit entangled.2) The iPad Air still heats up. I can't for the life of me figure out why I pay a company so much money when they make a product that heats up on full brightness. This is one hell of an annoying feature.3) The back on the iPad Air, the volume buttons, the power button, the menu button - they all seem a bit too delicate in comparison with the iPad 3. This is just an intuition or impression but I can't help but feel it needs to be treated gently.4) Safari has been needing an overhaul for the longest and I feel they need a better browser than the one they have right now. It often freezes on my iPad 3. It should be perfect like iMessage is perfect, like FaceTime is close to perfect, like email is perfect, it isn't quite up there. I would give it a 6/10 in terms of potential.5) iBooks - I read on my iPad more than anything else but the iBooks software also needs some more options of backgrounds and schemes. Apple plays safe for far too long but they need to give more options to make READERS WANT TO READ MORE.6) Syncing iTunes is a bit confusing. There should be more education given to all customers about preferred type of WIFI networks, sometimes applications don't update, I have no idea why they are doing this. I have to go to airplane mode and then go back up. The iCloud feature needs 10GB and Apple need to stop being a cheapskate.Conclusion -Get the iPad Air if you are looking for something with good design quality, good battery, an extra lightning cable (half joke) , something faster, smoother...this is about a 31% improvement over the iPad 3. Thats a big deal.Of my iPhone, macbook Air, iPad Air - I have always liked the iPads the most. They have reliable battery and never ever ever die on you like the other two. Its that simple and that keen.If they take into account some of the things I didn't like about this product, Apple can be made better overall. Ha!Buy the BLACK one, a WHITE IPAD a strict no.",
