        "property1": "I love Chromecast. I can find things on You Tube or Netflix and watch them all day long on the T.V. I wish it worked with Amazon's Prime Video though. Right now it is very limited in what it will work with. I'm hoping some day it will work with Amazon's videos as it is something sold on Amazon's site, I would expect it to be compatible with their products. My kids bought this for me for Christmas and I absolutely love it. The only reason 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't work with some of the things I'd like it to. I can cast a webpage or cast the desktop (experimental) to the T.V. but there is quite a bit of lag and movies and videos don't work well when viewed in this manner on the T.V.",
