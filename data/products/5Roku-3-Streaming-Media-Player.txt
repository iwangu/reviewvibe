Compact footprint, easy to use interface, and simple set up make this one a winner! Excellent product if you are a movie nut like me and need your Netflix & Amazon Prime Movie fix daily. =)",

        "property1": "Pros: Overall a good product. Streams Amazon and Netflix well. The remote control is simple and easy to use, seems durable, and looks like it will last a while. I like the sense of humor that touches some of the menus. There is a good choice of channels, although only a few are to my liking. The remote does not work very well as a game controller, but that's okay: I knew that feature was probably a gimmick and I was not expecting much. I don't mind the absence of a power button or a separate audio output (for my aging audio receiver). Those would have just increased the cost and are not really necessary.Con: The device crashes now and then. Sometimes it just reboots, and sometimes I have to unplug it to force it to reboot. This is not a big deal--it does not happen very often, and I expect this now in any non-trivial electronic product. (My Blu-ray player crashes sometimes! I suspect at some point modern toasters will start crashing.)Con: The main channel screen is always showing an ad which takes up about 1/3 of the entire screen. I don't spend a lot of time in that screen, but I still find it annoying in a product I paid for. I have not yet found an option to turn that off. Some people expect ads in everything now, but I do not.Con: Online registration is required to use the device. I can appreciate how this makes some things easier, but a simple plug-and-play device would have been better. Registration expects a name and email, although this was not stated on the box. I did know this in advance, so I had set up a fake email (I hope that doesn't bite me later when I forget the login for it).Con: The initial setup was frustrating because of the credit-card requirement during setup. The setup should have taken about 1 minute, but ended up taking over half an hour as I searched for solutions and ultimately used customer service. Some of you might argue that a credit card is not really a *requirement*, but consider that in two places on the website (the setup screen and the FAQ) they insist a credit card is required, with no alternative described. Yes, you can enter then remove the information, but a simple Skip button would do the same thing and make the process so much simpler. It is obvious why a customer might not want to give their CC information to a company, especially the first time they buy a product from them. And it makes me very suspicious when a company insists on a credit card. The box did not list a credit card as a requirement, and did not provide a customer service number. The website did not make clear there was an option to \"call this number to activate without a credit card\". Eventually I found a forum where this was discussed--I called customer service (which was friendly, if a little slow). Seriously Roku, a Skip button would be far more consumer-friendly, and show you respect your customers' privacy. First impressions are important, and even though I like your product this has left me distrustful.",
