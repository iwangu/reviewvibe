        "property1": "UPDATE 11182013:A number of comments seem to take issue with my statement of \"not feeling like glass\" but that is JUST MY PERSONAL FEELING. Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.",

        "property1": "First my background...I am an Apple user with a lot of Apple gadgets. I need to be on the computer for 7-12 hours a day.I already own a MacAir, which I love, but as light as it is, it still weighs about 3 pounds ( still, I highly recommend and love my MacAir!).Anyway, I also have an ipad 3 and an Ipad mini, iphone etc., you get the idea. The reason I am mentioning this, is because I have a bad back and that is the only reason I have been updating devices. I am trying to find the \"perfect\" computer for my use. If I can help even one other person out there in my situation ( and save them a ton of money I had to spend <g>), I will be happy! :)First let me tell you a little about the Ipad Air...IT ROCKS!!Although the speed on the Air is much faster then my Ipad 3, whether syncing with iTunes, browsing the web or just getting emails, the speed was not the reason I upgraded. I am not a game player or a number cruncher so the speed of the ipad 3 was just fine for me.What did get my attention was the weight! I had already bought the new ipad mini, which is super cool and a lot of fun.I actually intend to keep it. However, as good as it's screen is, I cannot see me using it 10 hours a day. If I had 20 year old eyes, it might have beat out my Air! ;-)The a Ipad 3 was about 1.7 pounds. That may not seem like a lot, but for me it could not be a one handed device. I needed to put a case on it, making it 2 pound device. Compared to the Ipad Air, which is about 1 pound, that was almost a 50% reduction in weight! The reason the reduction is so much, is I do not feel I need a case with the Air. I have covered it with clear coat all over and that is it. I do not seeing it slipping out of my hands. However, when I travel, I will use a 5 oz cover or just a Smart Cover (3.5 oz).I know it can be dangerous, not using a case, but I am extremely careful and i bought the special Apple warranty. Besides, isn't the reason we spend so much on these because they weigh so little and are aesthetically pleasing?It is too beautiful to cover up. So far, no regrets at all, but I need to find something to lean the Air against while lying down.If my review helped you, please click \"helpful\" below. Thanks :)",

        "property1": "yes I love it. I've had an iphone for years as has the rest of my family. I have to admit I read all about the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and I bought it two weeks ago. the specs were awesome for the price. the only thing is a lot of the things I needed were not compatible with it. then my granddaughter tried to facetime with me and of course I couldn't because Kindle doesn't have facetime. I told we would both have to download Skype to teleconference with eachother and she said forget it. too much trouble. then I'd have to buy new extra chargers/cables etc. just too much incompatibility. so I returned it and bought this and I'm thrilled and happy with it. if I wasn't used to Apple products I would have kept the the Kindle. just being honest as I don't want anyone to think that the Kindle wasn't good",

        "property1": "I was excited to purchase my first apple product. This unit was purchased from another retailer as part of a bundle and offered flexible payments. I was looking at the Air laptop, but then heard iPad air was coming out. Sadly it will be going back. iPad air is thin, lightweight, perfect size screen.The color is super sharp. Super fast typing and going from app to app,, when it wanted to work. Which meant I really couldn't tell you if they worked well or not. I'd only had it for a day and the screen froze. Could only go back to the home screen, then loose any work one might have done. Couldn't turn it off. Then, when I was getting ready to put it back in the box, amazingly it decided to work. The set-up wizard was super fast helping this technically challenged person set up and link all her accounts. I REALLY liked that it was a tablet and a small laptop as it came with an awesome keypad. So then I started downloading music and wanted to hear the small ball speaker that came in the bundle. The female plug in the air was not quite the right size. I couldn't get a snug fit, also tried with the ear buds and another speaker. And as I fidgeted with the plugs to get a secure connection to receive a signal, the song would stop playing and the volume on the screen kept going up and down. Is this supposed to happen???? As for the sound, I wasn't expecting much from such a thin tablet. The speakers were on the back side but I'm not sure if speakers could be placed in the front. But since the speaker plugs won't fit, what's the point? You'd need to buy some blue-tooth speakers to really hear better soundIt would be hard for me to compare the ipad air to other tablets as this would have been my first touch-screen device other than my android smart phone.I'd have to agree with previous reviews. I also feel this device was rushed on the market before X-mas. With the screen freezing and the plug being poorly made, is a good indication of frantically putting something together and getting it on the market for the holidays. I really hope that the next generation iPad air will be greatly improved as I really like apple products,and software, and was hoping this would be the first.Apple, I am disappointed. You can do a lot better. Quit cutting corners and please remember you have a reputation to protect.",

        "property1": "I'll get right to it. This product is designed for 64-bit operation; however, Apple has yet to debug the software provided with it. The biggest challenge has been crashes while using Safari .... Arghhhh. These crashes don't happen with my iPad Mini, so I know it is isolated to the Air.The AppleCare tech has acknowledged that the issue has been reported by other users, but Apples engineers have yet to offer any solution. In short, this product is not ready for prime time.I'll consider revision of this review if and when Apple fixes the problem. But, I know this will never be a 5 star review given the time wasted to date going through hours of debug exercises.",

        "property1": "Because I love my Kindle Keyboard, I was firm in my resolve to upgrade to the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\". The need for both color for children's books and my own need for a white background to provide contrast when reading were my primary motivators. The price and versatility of the Kindle were better than other options available. I do not use my device as a media player, but that seemed to be a nice option. However, my spouse insisted I look at the \"Apple iPad Air\" before I made any purchase.After looking at the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and the \"Apple iPad Air\" side-by-side in the big electronics retailer, I had to admit it, he was right! Clarity on both devices was excellent, particularly as I intended to use the item primarily as an e-reader. However, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" kept freezing up; the blue shirted employees said that was a frequent occurrence. The \"Apple iPad Air\" connected easily to WiFi and navigation was smooth and seamless. The ability to use many of the same programs I have installed on my PC is a plus. Downloading books is quick and the \"Apple iPad Air\" does not bog down so that it seems painfully slow when I try to change from a book to the main menu page. Using the \"Apple iPad Air\" is intuitive, even for those individuals - like me -who are not especially tech-savvy. Based on recommendations and the fact that I would use the tablet when traveling, I purchased the \"Apple iPad Air\" 16 GB with the ability to connect to AT&T.The principle downside of purchasing the \"Apple iPad Air\" is its initial cost. Individuals who are debating between purchasing a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and an \"Apple iPad Air\" should look at the two side-by-side; consider their primary uses and personal preferences; and evaluate the price difference in light of those factors. While I don't like having to admit my spouse was right, I do love my \"Apple iPad Air\". If it fits your needs, you may find the \"Apple iPad Air\" is a tablet you will love, too.",
