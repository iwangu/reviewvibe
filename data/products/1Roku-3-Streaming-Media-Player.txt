        "property1": "The Roku 3 is an awesome upgrade from my previous Roku 2. (and from my previous Apple TV)First of all, it is very easy and quick to set up.The Roku 3's user interface is just awesome, and much snappier than the pervious one.It's much easier to navigate the channels with the new user interface. They also added a centralized search where you can search for titles or actors across all channels and they then show which channels offer that content.This is really an AWESOME and very useful feature!Besides the improved UI, I really love the new remote control, which contains a head-set jack and volume controls.When you plug-in a head-set, the audio on the Roku's HDMI interface is automatically muted, and re-routed to the head-sets. This is awesome when watching movies at night when your loved-ones are asleep, and might be equally useful when you ask your kids to use the head-set, so you don't have to listen to Dora the Explorer all day long..I should add that the audio-quality on the headsets is truly HiFi - it blew me away!Roku offers TONS of channels on the Roku! No comparison to the very limited number of channels on the Apple TV.I think Roku says they have +700 channels now.Some of my favourite channels are: - Amazon (some movies included with Amazon Prime!!) - Vudu (amazing video quality!) - Netflix (their selection really gets worse every day) - Hulu - TimeWarner channel - HBO Go - Disney - Smithsonian Channel - great music channels, like: Pandora Radio, Amazon Cloud Player, SomaFM, ... - tons of science & tech channels, like: TED Talks, CNet, NASA, ... - tons of food channels - tons of domestic and international news channel, like CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera, Euronews, Tagesschau, Deutsche Welle, and many more! - lots of international channels - many more..Do a web-search to find the complete list of all available Roku private channels, and check out the VideoBuzz channel!One almost hidden feature of the Roku3 is that it has a USB3 port on the side -- that means that you can plug in a USB-flash drive or a USB disk, and play content you own from there! USB Media Formats: Video: MP4 (H.264), MKV (H.264) Audio: AAC, MP3, Image: JPG, PNG.One small thing to look out: make sure to switch your video to 1080p in the settings menu, it starts with 720p resolution.My home-theater setup consists of an Optoma 1080p projector, with the Roku3 connected to it, and a 133\" screen.The video quality is just amazing!! I lOVE my new Roku 3!Compared to the Roku2, there is no audio-out jack on the back of the Roku3 - this was not a big issue for me, because I have an inexpensive HDMI Switcher which provides audio-out: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L14WB8/Last not least: how does the Roku3's price of $99 stack up against the competition? With the Roku3 you get more channel choices than what you get with the Apple TV.If you compare it to \"smart\" TVs, like Samsung and others, these manufacturers charge exorbitant amounts for their \"smart\" TV features, compared to their regular TV models -- you'd pay several hundred dollars more, and you would end up with less -- and you'd be waving your hands at your TV.So if you compare the Roku3 to \"smart\" TVs, the Roku3 is an obvious choice because of it's low cost, more channels, and the much sleeker user interface.All in all, I think this product is a BIG step up from the previous Roku 2 and far ahead of the Apple TV, which I have not used since I switched to Roku.If you own an Apple TV, or already own a pervious Roku model, I'd definitely recommend to upgrade to the Roku 3!If you are in the market for a new TV, then go for the non-smart version, and add a Roku3!You won't regret it! It's awesome!P.S.:It puzzles me that some people have left bad reviews for the Roku3. Some comments where related to streaming quality, which sounds more like they have only a very basic internet connection. If you want to stream HDTV video over the internet, make sure that you have an adequate / high-end internet connection (don't try to save money on that). Another comment was the 90-day warranty. Sure, that's true, but I don't think it's an issue given that the Roku3 does not contain any moving parts -- chances of it breaking are very very very slim. I had my previous Roku for years and it still works like a charm.last not least, one comment was that you have to provide a credit card to connect to the Roku channel store. That's just the same with a lot of other services, and devices, e.g. the Apple TV. It's really no surprise, as there are some Roku channels which can be purchased. Does any of that make the Roku3 a bad device? Absolutely no! It is the best device in it's class, and I find it just awesome to use.",

        "property1": "I think some that are complaining about channel selection being worthless are unsure how to make the most out of your Roku.Not only do you have Netflix, Hulu Plus and Vudu for movie rentals...but Roku is DLNA. Which means if you install a media server on your computer it will stream it to the Roku. The Plex app is on Roku and is free, however Playon is a great choice. I actually run both at once. Playon is a yearly fee. When they have a sale like now it is only 24.99 a year, or you can get a lifetime licence for 49.99 and never pay again. Which any way you look at it is far cheaper than cable. They also have a Playlater service which records shows for you so you can watch later. There are many plugins that come with it... ABC, NBC, CBS, History, Discovery, Spike, Lifetime, CW, MTV, VH1, Animal Planet, Fox, etc practically all the cable networks are there that post their shows episodes online for public viewing which Playon makes available. If you don't pay for Hulu Plus you can still watch free Hulu through Playon as well.Many don't know about it so thought I would let you all know there is alot you can do with Roku outside of Roku channels.:)",

        "property1": "I like to review my products fully. Package to Play.PACKAGING: Let's start of with the packaging. Great design, easily deconstructed for easy assembly. I didn't have to use scissors or cut myself on sharp plastic, HOORAY! Sweet. The only improvement on packaging is that I almost threw away the headphones. They were hidden in a side compartment, but honestly, I am like a kid in a candy store, so I was ripping through the package like a crack head trying to find his keys so he can go to the moon. Anyways...SETUP: The instructions were easy. It's a simple plug in, put the batteries in the remote, and put in my WIFI password. If you have trouble at this point, I would probably never attempt LEGOS or IKEA furniture. Like...ever. The cute little dancing ROKU at start-up was a plus. The actual start-up was a breeze as well. I had all my username and passwords handy for my life staples: HULU+, Netflix, Amazon Prime. I am not a cable user (who wants to pay for 100 channels when you only use a few) so I don't have the full capabilities and functions of whole Roku3, but it has everything I need, plus a few bonuses I didn't know about, Disney for my nieces and nephews, some free news channels (if the need to be depressed arises), and Sci-Fi (nerd squeal, snort)!SIDENOTE: Some of the applications have simplified data entry (.com input, etc), I assume this is because of how the application wants you to sign up (and not Roku), but they should all get on board with a simplified keyboard for smoother setup.REMOTE: Great. I love having a remote for this. Its no different than having a Wii Remote or a PS3 controller. Wireless and all that jazz. Even has a safety strap for those who walk around all day with chicken grease all over their hands. The big plus is the headphones that come with it. I tested those out as well. The controller automatically mutes the TV and puts the sound through the ear buds. Neat. Great for when the Mr. or Mrs. wants to sleep, you don't want to wake the kids, or you have one of those crappy old neighbors with supersonic hearing and even complains when you tip toe after 10pm. A couple of improvements could be made here however. First, as a Visual Communications Specialist, please refrain from super shiny material in remote construction. It's a cleaning nightmare (a shout-out to those of us with OCD) and makes the plastic look super cheap. Secondly, a simple programming change so you can use the remote sideways for easier data entry.PLAY: I have to say (not sure how this is possible), but the high definition looks better than my PS3? Either way, smooth playback, great experience, no complaints there. I have had it for almost a week now, and no hiccups what so ever. Another great function is that Roku never turns off (if you are weird about power, just unplug it, but it only takes the power of a nightlight, so cool your jets). I just turn my TV back on, and all my stuff is ready to go, no logging in, no waiting for booting.OVERALL: Amazing product. If you are not wanting to buy this product because you already own a streaming device (PS3, Wii, etc), you are missing out on a a ton of extras and perks not available on those systems. My PS3 has now just become where I watch old DVDs (soon to go the way of the dinosaur) and video games.For me, it's a must have! Plus, if you want to be cool like me, you should go buy it. Dude...like now. :)",
